2013-Ness-NeatoDash
==============
The NeatoDash project can be found at 
http://neatodash.blogspot.com/

The MRF24J40 library can be found at
http://mbed.org/users/mlab4/code/ESE350-Whack-a-Mole/

The MODSERIAL library only works on the LPC1768 and can be found
http://mbed.org/cookbook/MODSERIAL

GoalieMode enables the neato to block a soccer ball in a parallel alley

ReceiverModeRX is to be used with ReceiverModeTX to control neato using
the MRF24J40 wireless modules

StalkerMode is to track objects or person in an alley and basically run 
into them one after the other. 

The code requires communication with the internal serial port of the neato
which requires the user to chmod 777 the outside serial port
